# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `project_config_dir(name, *, environ=None)` — resolves and creates
  `~/.molcrafts/<name>/config/` so downstream tools (e.g. `molq` writing a SQLite
  database) share a stable user-level configuration directory. `MOLCRAFTS_HOME`
  overrides the base; empty / whitespace values fall back to the default. The
  `environ` kwarg accepts an injected mapping for full isolation from
  `os.environ` in tests.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-18

Release suite bump — no functional changes beyond 1.3.0.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `Registry[T]` — a tag-to-factory container mapping string keys (e.g. `"silu"`) to classes or callables, with three access modes:
  - `registry.build(spec)` resolves a config value into an instance. Accepts `str` (short form), `dict` with a `type` discriminator plus kwargs (long form), `None`, or an existing instance (idempotent).
  - `registry.get(name)` returns the raw factory/class without instantiating — for APIs that take `type[T]` (e.g. PyTorch modules).
  - `registry.register(key, factory)` or the `@registry("key")` decorator form.
- `Build(registry)` — `typing.Annotated` metadata marker that runs `registry.build(...)` on a field before type validation. Works uniformly across JSON, TOML, and YAML sources, and on default values.
- `docs/registry.md` guide and `docs/examples` section covering short/long forms, `.get()` vs `.build()`, and integration with `validate()`.

### Changed

- `validate()` now calls `get_type_hints(schema, include_extras=True)` so `Annotated` metadata is preserved for the new `Build` marker.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- `YamlFileSource` for loading configuration from YAML files.

### Changed

- PyYAML is now a required runtime dependency (previously molcfg had no runtime dependencies).
- Dropped the "zero-dependency" framing from the package description and docs.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Zensical-based documentation site under `docs/` with usage, validation, source loading, concurrency, and release pages.
- `Config.meta()` and loader-level source tracking for merged configuration values.
- Automatic type coercion for `EnvSource` and `CliSource`, with `coerce=False` escape hatch.
- Recursive schema validation for nested schemas and `list[Schema]`.
- `validate(..., allow_extra=False, apply_defaults=True)` for stricter and more useful validation flows.
- Release engineering files: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `RELEASING.md`, `LICENSE`, `zensical.toml`.

### Changed

- Promoted package version from `0.1.0` to `1.0.0`.
- Changed the PyPI distribution name to `molcrafts-molcfg` while keeping the Python import path as `molcfg`.
- Expanded project metadata in `pyproject.toml` for packaging, documentation, and release publishing.
- Strengthened `ThreadSafeConfig` so nested reads stay inside the same lock boundary.
- Fixed merge and source-loading aliasing so callers receive isolated nested data.

### Fixed

- `CliSource` no longer consumes the next CLI flag as a value for a flag without an explicit value.
- `Config` attribute access now correctly returns config values even when keys collide with method names like `items` or `keys`.
- Snapshot and rollback semantics now preserve metadata alongside configuration data.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Initial release of `molcfg` with config container, sources, merge strategies, validation helpers, interpolation, and concurrency utilities.
